# Maxflow_Visualization

## Acknowledgments

The initial styling and the choice of Cytoscape framework were inspired by [this project](https://github.com/isabek/isabek.github.io). We consulted professor [David Kempe](https://www.david-kempe.com/) at University of Southern California and [this slide](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f11/lectures/lects12-14.pdf) from Carnegie Mellon University on algorithms. We appreciate their work.
